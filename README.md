This is a personal website highlighting two lies and one truth about me. If the user gets some of the answers wrong it will highlight all of the correct answers in green and give a score. Try to get a 10 out of 10 and you may know me! I had fun making this one and actually read the instructions wrong initially. It was supposed to be two truths and a lie but I did it the other way around and stuck with it once I had already coded everything. In the javascript I used an object to make the quiz work.
